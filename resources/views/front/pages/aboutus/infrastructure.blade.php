    <h4> The importance of having a good school infrastructure.:</h4>

    *** It is a fact that having schools in good conditions is decisive for students to achieve the expected academic results.For those who love to read and study, any place can be good to read and learn. They might argue that the space you are in does not matter, that knowledge is immaterial, that the physical context is secondary, and that what is important is to concentrate in what you are reading.  

But if we transfer this reasoning to the reality of educational systems, the empiric evidence is flagrant: having rooms and learning spaces in good conditions is decisive for students to achieve the expected academic results. In other words, the conditions of the schools directly impacts the performance of the students.  

The fact is that a good school infrastructure, with renewed spaces, makes it possible for children and youths that live in remote areas to study and, in addition, tends to improve the attendance and interest of students and teachers in learning. For this same reason, investments in school infrastructure have an essential role in solving access problems of students to the school system and to improve their performance.

    <h4>Goal Setting and Progress:</h4>

    *** Staff and family members or carers set goals together, during fortnightly home visits
    We require you to attend Individual Education Plan meetings, half-termly
    We chart behaviour, interaction and independent life skills
    Young people are motivated by real life rewards that matter

Learning is continuously assessed against the goals and targets set. This enables staff to identify strengths and weaknesses and to help your child progress in a positive and targeted direction.
Read more in our Ofsted report.

“Each pupil’s curriculum is underpinned by a detailed, high quality individual educational plan. These are developed by the multi-disciplinary staff team together with the pupil, and parents/carers.

The plans provide numerous targets for curriculum subjects and areas of the pupils’ development and contribute significantly to their progress and well-being.”

One of our recent leavers has asked that this statement be posted on the school website, he says ‘..so that people can see the difference Park House School makes’:
